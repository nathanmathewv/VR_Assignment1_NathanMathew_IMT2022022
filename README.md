# VR Assignment : Coin Segmentation and Panoramic Image Stitching

# Overview

This project consists of two parts:

- **Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting**: Uses computer vision techniques to detect, segment, and count Indian coins from an image.
- **Panorama Creation**: Stitches multiple overlapping images into a seamless panorama.

## Requirements

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanmathewv/VR_Assignment1_NathanMathew_IMT2022022.git
cd VR_Assignment1_NathanMathew_IMT2022022
```

## Part 1

### Features
- Detects coins using edge detection.
- Segments each detected coin using contour analysis and removes unwanted noisy detections.
- Counts the total number of coins.

### Running the code
Run the Python Notebook and see the results on the notebook itself.
